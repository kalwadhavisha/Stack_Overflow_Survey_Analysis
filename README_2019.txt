1. Installation:
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


2. Project Motivation:
For this project, I have chosen the Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:

As a programmer, which half of the world has more opportunities? The West or the East?
What is the salary difference in the western world and in the eastern world?
How are the programmers satisfying about their job between these two sides of the world?
Are there more jobs opportunity in the western world than that in the eastern world?
What is the Sex ratio of the developers on both sides of the world?

3. File Description:

The enclosed data set is the full, cleaned results of the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Free response submissions and personally identifying information have been removed from the results to protect the privacy of respondents. There are three files besides this README:

1. survey_results_public.csv - CSV file with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer
2. survey_results_schema.csv - CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name
3. so_survey_2019.pdf - PDF file of survey instrument
4. Blog_Post_Stack_OverFlow.ipynb - Jupiter notebook containing all the analysis


Respondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top 5 sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, Meta posts, banner ads, and social media posts.
